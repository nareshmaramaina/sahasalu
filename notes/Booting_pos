Hardware = SOC | pheripharal interface

SOC = CPU + MMU + Memory controller + interrupt controller + bus controllers + DMA + Device Controllers 


Boot ROM 

	- Reside at reset vector
	-Intitalizes the Following 
	CPU Clocks ,
	 CPU caches  
	Static Memory 

	Boot Device Controller 
		Any or all of the following 
			Nand / nor flash SD MMC controller 

	Initilization of memory controller or Dynamic controller initilization ( DRAM controller ) optional 

	Load Boot loader ( FSBLor SSBL  )  into preconfigured Address space 

-FSBL ( First Stage Boot Loader ) 
 - Loaded into Static RAM from stroage 
  Intilize DRAM controller 
Load SSBL into Memory


- SSBL ( Boot loader )
	
	Resides of on board stroage
	loaded into Dynamic memory either by FSBL or Boot-ROM 

	-Initilize the following 
		-Console
		- Stroage Device Controllers ( USB / SD / MMC  )
		- Network Controllers
		Allocate Address space for kernel 
	
	- Fetch and load kernel , BSP ( DT ) images from preconfigured  stroage  or netwokr into memory 

	- Setup kernel Parameters 

	- Invoke kernel's boot strap with board information 


- Kernel Boot ( SAme like x86 )

Interrupt is an event that alter sequence of exectiobns execution  by a processor in corresponding to electrical signals rasied by h/w circuts by the inside and outside CPU. 


Driver interrupt handler :-

It is register with interrupt management subsystem through kernel IRQ number. 

These functions are invoked by interrupt management layer upon suspending processor schedular and masking interrupt in local CPU. Local CPU's  interrputs are tuned only on FSPA, 

Driver ISR's must be register as instance of type struct IRQ action with interrupt sub system.
 

IRQ descriptor table is the core data structure which hlods reference 	of driver interrupt hanlders and kernel IRQ properties 

request_irq(irq,my_interrupt,IRQF_SHARED,"my_interrupts",&my_dev_id);


Software options for resource partioning 

CPU affinity and interrupt affinity 
Contianers virtualization 

Hardware option for resource porting / allocations 

* Partition hardware to assign dedicated processing powr for data processing and control ooerations 



Do's and don't s to achieve deterministic exection of ISR's 

Don't :- 
1) Avoid memory allocation calls 
2) Avoid process sharing data structr or buffers 


Do's:-

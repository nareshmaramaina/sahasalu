Softirqs are a set of statically defined bottom halves that
can run simultaneously on any processor; even two of the same type can run concur-
rently.

Tasklets, which have an awful and confusing name, 2 are flexible, dynamically cre-
ated bottom halves built on top of softirqs.Two different tasklets can run concurrently on
different processors, but two of the same type of tasklet cannot run simultaneously.Thus,
tasklets are a good trade-off between performance and ease of use.
For most bottom-half
processing, the tasklet is sufficient. Softirqs are useful when performance is critical, such as
with networking. Using softirqs requires more care, however, because two of the same
softirq can run at the same time. In addition, softirqs must be registered statically at com-
pile time. Conversely, code can dynamically register tasklets.

kernel modules
	
	1. kernel modules are special binary files that are used to insert kernel 
           services dynamically (@runtime)
	2. modules are identified using file extension .ko
	3. kernel manages modules using a framework called kmod

issues to be considered while writing kernel module sources

1. include kernel headers only
	$KERNEL_HEADER = /lib/modules/($shell uname -r)/build/include

2. modules can contain constructor(init) and destructor(exit) functions
   constructor is executed when module is loaded and destructor is run
   when module is unloaded

	int init_module(void)
	void cleanup_module(void)

3. use appropriate comment macros to insert code information or description 
   comments, using these macros makes comments available in module binary 
   file(.ko file).

4. modules can contain any number  of functions or data elements that define a    kernel service, often these are referred as module body.

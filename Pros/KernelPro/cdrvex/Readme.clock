
We allow the applications to view the clock as a file with the following
tion. 

DDMMYYHHMMSS 

The size of the file is 12 bytes ( 2 bytes for day and so on ..).

File can be read as well as written ( date can be set or obtained).

Real Time clock stores data in BCD format . We are not applying any conversion
here. We just assume that the application sends data to the driver in BCD 
format .

For example to set data month as 12 the application sets it as 0x12.

Data will be updated to the clock as soon as the application writes the data.
Similarly data will be read from the clock as soon as the application
asks for the data.

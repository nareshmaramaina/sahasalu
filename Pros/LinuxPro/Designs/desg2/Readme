In This design we use three layers

1) UI -- same as desg1 , but calls uses VIML instead of IML.

2) VIML -- virtual image manuplation layer. This layer is responsible
	   to make use of functions provided by IML.

3) IML -- same as desg1 , with this design we can have multiple 
	  implementataions to take care of different image formats.



Note : In this example we have added two handlers.

Follow the procedure to add new handler.

1) implement a new handler with three functions in xxx.c

2) add a global variable xxxhandler of type imageHandler and fill
   it with pointers to the functions.

3) add extern declaration to handlers.h file.

4) add pointer to the above sturcture to the array imagehandlers in
   config.c file.

5) re-link your app.

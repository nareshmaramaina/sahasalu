In this example ( project ) we used two layers

1) UI -- takes care of handling user interface.

2) IML -- image manuplation layer ( takes care of different image types).

our application is designed to handle only one type of files.

When we want to build this application to take care of new images
we need to replace IML which takes care of new images.

We will enhance this design in next example to take care of multiple
image formats.

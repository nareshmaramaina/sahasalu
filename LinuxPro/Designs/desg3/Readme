Same as Design 2 , In this implementataion we used SO to increase
flexibility in adding new handlers easily to your application.

In this example we used special functions _init and _fini as part of SO
for registering and unregistering the handlers.

Link the application using -rdynamic flag so that the so's can access the
functions reg_handler and unreg_handler.
